        <h2>What is Networking?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Networking is Building Relationships.</strong></li>
          <li>
            Leverage your circle of friends, family, professors, previous
            employers, and the University of Michigan Alumni.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be curious about the person you are connecting with to learn more
            about their career. Networking isn’t about winning people over or
            asking for a job. We recommend asking for informational interviews,
            which are short meetings or calls with someone in a field of
            interest to learn more about their job, their industry, their career
            pathway, and to hear their advice.

          As employers and graduate schools are looking for ways to get to know
          candidates virtually, your online “brand” is going to take on even
          more significance. You need to consider ways to stand out that are
          beyond what you may have done when “in-person” connections were more
          the norm. <br />
          <br />Here are some quick tips to get you started:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Manage your online presence:</strong> What you tweet or post
            publicly is part of your professional image, whether or not you
            intend it to be. Be mindful of your privacy settings and/or consider
            the audiences that can see your posts before you publish.
            Bottomline, make sure your content is suitable for future recruiters
            to review.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Update on LinkedIn.</strong> If you currently consider your
            LinkedIn profile to have “the basics”, now is the time to develop an
            effective profile and get active. Recruiters want to see what you
            have been involved with, what matters to you, who you follow, and
            what you are interested in. Watch this Learning LinkedIn Video for
            Students to uncover everything you need to know from creating a
            profile to growing your network, to following influencers, and
            sharing content. (LinkedIn account linked to your umich email is
            required).
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Get active on social media.</strong> Consider leveraging
            social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook to highlight and
            build upon your industry expertise. Incorporate your professional
            brand into your bio by using hashtags related to your interest
            areas, following leaders in your field, and retweeting top industry
            stories.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Create a blog and/or website.</strong> Remember, employers
            are looking, online, for additional ways to learn about applicants.
            Blogs or websites are a great way to showcase your personality,
            skills, interests, and other important qualities. Find out why this
            matters to recruiters and check out the following (free!) tools for
            creating sites: Wix, Squarespace, or Wordpress.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Maintain your profiles:</strong> As you gain more
            experience, education, and skills, your profiles should change!
            Revisit your Handshake, LinkedIn, and social media profiles, and
            update, update, update!
