        <h2>First Things First: Prepare Your Resume, Cover Letter, And More</h2>
        <p>
          Once the ball starts rolling on your search, you’ll need to be able to
          quickly showcase your qualifications to employers and connections. As
          you begin your search, you’ll want to have:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://careercenter.umich.edu/article/resume-resources"
              target="_blank"
              >Resumes</a
            >
            <ul>
              <li>
                ​You'll eventually end up tailoring your resumes to specific
                jobs, but creating your resume early or freshening up an
                existing resume makes things easier when it's time to apply.
                Once you feel confident with your draft, you can use it as a
                foundation to then tailor it to the different roles to which you
                are applying.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

              target="_blank"
              >Cover Letters</a
            >
            <ul>
              <li>
                ​Cover Letters aren't always required, but getting familiar with
                what to include before you start applying can help you easily
                create one when it is required. Even when not required, if there
                is an option to submit one and it is an organization you are
                interested in, expressing that interest in a cover letter that
                highlights your skills and experiences can go a long way.

            Digital Profiles
            <ul>
              <li>
                ​Your digital "brand" is important in this virtual environment.
                You'll want to make sure your online and social media profiles
                are complete and showcase you well when employers are searching
                online for candidates. By freshening up your profiles, these
                tools can start working for you by notifying you of targeted job
                postings recommendations and connections. We recommend starting
                with profiles on LinkedIn, Handshake, UCAN.

            <ul>
              <li>
                ​Plan ahead! Interviewing is a SKILL -- you want to get good at
                it! Interviews can be scheduled on short timelines in a search
                process, so get ahead of the game by preparing and practicing.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Organizational websites</strong>- Most organizations have a
            “careers” page for you to view current openings (and sometimes
            recruiter contact information which allows you to reach out in
            another way by sending your resume directly to that person!)

          <li>
            <strong>Broad job/internship boards</strong>- The two most popular[]
            are Indeed and LinkedIn. Use one of these to find out about
            opportunities at organizations you don’t already have on your
            prospect list.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Industry specific job boards</strong>- Talk to people in
            your desired industry (hint: use alumni in UCAN!) to find out where
            jobs for specific industries are posted. For example, government
            jobs use USAJobs.gov and many nonprofit organizations use Idealist.

              Please note that if you are an international student, it is likely
              that you will need some type of work authorization to pursue a
              micro-internship. Please visit the International Center to see if
              you are qualified for OPT/CPT before engaging in a
              micro-internship experience.
            </p>

          <li>
            <strong>Job Shadowing:</strong> Reach out to professionals in your
            area of interest through LinkedIn, UCAN, or email and inquire about
            shadowing opportunities. This experience provides insight into
            day-to-day operations in your desired field and can help you build

            great way to show initiative and build a body of work that can
